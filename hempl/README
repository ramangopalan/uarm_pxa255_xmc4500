Hempl
=====

Hempl is recursive for Hempl's embedded mini PicoLisp.

It is a software system for natively programming microcontrollers
(interactively and incrementally) using PicoLisp. Hempl can read
S-expressions from a micro SD card or from the console (over UART, USB
or Telnet).

Hempl is influenced by and is a fork of the eLua project. For now, it
runs on the following hardware platforms:

* Mizar32 models A, B and C from SimpleMachines, Italy
* STM3210E evaluation board (stm32f103ze) and ET-STM32 stamp board

The Hempl project is named after "Hempel", a good friend from
Munich. He also introduced Raman to Augustiner Edelstoff and Schneider
Weisse ;)
